# Weather App
This project is my introduction to APIs. The weather app project was a hands-on learning experience where I utilized HTML, CSS, and JavaScript alongside the webpack module bundler to create a functional application. Through this project, I gained a deep understanding of API integration, specifically with weather APIs. The app allowed users to input location details, fetching real-time weather data from an external API. It displayed the current weather conditions along with additional details like temperature, humidity, and wind speed in a user-friendly interface. The use of webpack enabled efficient bundling and management of the project's assets, optimizing the app's performance and enhancing my skills in frontend development and API utilization.
